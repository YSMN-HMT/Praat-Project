## Project Overview
This project is based on the original description of software for voice feature extraction using Praat, a well-known speech analysis tool.
Praat processes voice recordings and associated Textgrids, and by utilizing custom Praat scripts, we extract various voice features for analysis.

Each patient attended screenings over 3 years to track the progression or diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Voice recording sessions were conducted at least 4 times per patient, including 29 distinct voice tasks. Praat is used to extract voice features, which are then analyzed through regression models to predict clinical outcomes.
